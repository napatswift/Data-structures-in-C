# Data structures in C

## Array
A data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. (Wikipedia)

## Linked list
Blocks of data and an address of (a reference, or a *link*, to) next block. Or each element points to the next element. The block, in this context, is called *Node*.

## Stack


## Queues
A list or collection with the restriction that insertion can be performed at one end (so called rear) and deletion can also be performed at other end (so called front)

### Operations
- `Enqueue(val)` to add an element into queue
- `Dequeue()` to delete an element from queue, return that element
- `Front()` to get first element from queue
- `IsEmpty()` to check if the queue is empty

all of the operations take constant time or O(1)
